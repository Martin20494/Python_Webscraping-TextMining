If you find the lift to the 4th floor slow just think about how lifts work in skyscrapers. In Guangzhou, southern China, is a skyscraper due to be completed in 2016. The lift in that building will reach speeds of
to carry its passengers to the 95th floor. Because of the height and the speed the lift will change air pressure as it travels so no-one's ears get blocked. The tower may also warp slightly in the wind, so guiding rollers will help keep the ride smooth. If the lift malfunctions normal brakes could fail because of heat, so brakes able to resist extreme heat will activate in an emergency. What goes up fast must come down fast. BBC.
