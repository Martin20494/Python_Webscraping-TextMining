It is a diet "truth" that we're used to hearing: we eat too much salt and need to cut back.
• At a population level, reducing sodium intake reduces both blood pressure and risk of heart disease.
• New Zealanders currently eat around 9 grams of salt a day; our body needs less than 1 gram to survive. To reduce risk of chronic disease it is recommended to eat no more than 4g salt a day, a little less than the WHO's 5g a day.
