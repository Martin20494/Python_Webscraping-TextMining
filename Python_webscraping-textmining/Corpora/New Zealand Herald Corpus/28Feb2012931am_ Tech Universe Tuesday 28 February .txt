closed-loop Rankine cycle power plant. The process relies on using the warm water to boil ammonia which spins a turbine-generator. Cool water then condenses the ammonia again. New graphite-foam-based heat exchangers are particularly efficient for this use. At the moment the concept is being studied, with a demonstration planned in 2012. It
