Great toÂ see that the left is continuing to bag farmers and has no grasp on the importance of dairying to our economy and the standard of living enjoyed by us all in this country.
There'll be no saving of us if her good mate Andrew Little ever leads the Labour Party. This reflects the cocky comments from previous deputy PM Michael Cullen, who skited that he'd been educated by wealthy Canterbury farmers through a scholarship to Christ's College and then Canterbury University, but it wouldn't stop him screwing them in government.
Our whole economy is built on growing produce we sell to the world. Ms Kelly's swollen Public Service Association membership would never be able to survive an hour without farming because they produce nothing that can be sold on any market in the world.
It is about time those on the left understood New Zealand farms are cleaner than any in the world. We plant more trees, use better animal husbandry practices, produce better products and compete under tighter constraints than any other primary production country. We should be applauding our farmers.
