A leaked review of Auckland Council's waste strategy has questioned the goal of eliminating all household waste going to landfill by 2040 when business makes up 86 per cent of waste.
According to the review, the council seeks "to reduce waste to landfill as an end in itself, without quantifying the environmental, health and cultural benefits to see if these justify the cost and showing the initiatives provide the biggest environmental, health and cultural bang for buck".
