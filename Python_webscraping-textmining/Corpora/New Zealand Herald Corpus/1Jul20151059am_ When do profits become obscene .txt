A case was recently before the Christchurch District Court in which a caregiver was convicted after stealing from residents at a retirement village where she worked.
They trusted her; she stole from them.
What Bronwyn Saunders had done with the jewellery is worth considering ... carefully.
In one instance, she had taken five rings, worth $12,922, to Cash Converters Papanui, where they gave her $50 for one ring and $316 for the rest. One of the rings alone was worth $5000. Cash Converters on-sold it for $1000.
Is anyone else seeing another crime here, or is it just me?
It's obvious that the reality is somewhat different.
So here's the story. Bronwyn Saunders visited the same Cash Converters store twice, each time bringing in large, expensive amounts of jewellery, for which she was prepared to part for a pittance. This wasn't an old woman confused by modern trading practices; this was a criminal eager to find a buyer for illegally obtained items. She would have had some idea of their worth and yet was quite happy to take next to nothing for them.
Then the store offers her, in exchange for these very valuable items, rubbish money - insulting money. She takes it. Cash Converters must have been rubbing their hands with glee imagining the huge profits they were about to make with one transaction! And they got away with it! From my perspective, that store was as much guilty of theft as the woman who stole the rings, but they are not being prosecuted. Why not? Is there no Fair Trading Act to protect people from these rip-off merchants?
Is there no protection from that sort of unscrupulous trading? Are they within their rights to steal from their customers - because it is theft? And do all such stores work that way, or is it just that particular branch?
Someone should be ashamed. Moreover, someone should be held responsible.
