The summer of 2010/11 is looking ominously like a repeat of last year.
Whether we like it or not, we rely on the farming sector, particularly dairying, for general prosperity and growth. This sector has managed year-on-year productivity gains without support or subsidies for many years.
This is compounded by returns from dairy farms only averaging 2-3 per cent. Farmers are really farming land equity than production profits. Like the house sector, the economic fundamentals are wrong.
If we are all serious about improving our economy, our pay rates and catching Australia, a new more positive attitude needs to be developed across society.
On the surface it seems fair and logical but is it?
All farms are now monitored and the practice of allowing effluent to run untreated into farm drains a distant memory. So surely water quality has improved? When this question was posed, officials hesitated. The information was not available. Surely the effort and cost must have delivered results.
