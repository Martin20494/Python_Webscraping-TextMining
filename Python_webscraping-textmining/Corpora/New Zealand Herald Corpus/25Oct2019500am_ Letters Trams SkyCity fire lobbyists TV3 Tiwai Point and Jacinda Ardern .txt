In a rational world, Auckland Transport would be trying to find out whether or not there was a problem – and maybe there is. Then they would look at what we have got – airport express buses and airport shuttles – to see if they could cope with the increasing demand.
In the not too distant future airport shuttles could be replaced by driverless minibuses with computer optimised routing that are now being tested in Singapore.
To my knowledge, no one has studied the problem and the options. Instead, they are determined to squander our money on an expensive, obsolete solution that will not solve the problem.
