Bay of Plenty dairy farmers were reminded of the serious penalties for polluting after three farmers were this month sentenced for causing various degrees of contamination to waterways last year.
In the District Court in Tauranga, Langford Holdings Limited, of Waihi Beach, was convicted for discharging dairy effluent onto land and was fined $13,000.
Kildarragh Farms Limited, in Rotoura, was convicted for discharging dairy effluent onto land and was fined $12,000.
Bay of Plenty Regional Council Group Manager Water Management Eddie Grogan said this was a timely reminder to holders of resource consents that they must be compliant all the time.
"As a consequence of the problems experienced last season we have been working closely with Federated Farmers, Fonterra and DairyNZ to collaboratively develop some great tools to help farmers to achieve and maintain compliance," he said.
