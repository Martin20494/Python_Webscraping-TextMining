A parliamentary agency which exists to improve the environment has increased its use of electricity, air travel and vehicles, but claims its carbon footprint has shrunk.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report for 2008/2009 said the office had managed to decrease its carbon footprint despite increases in its polluting activities.
Air travel had increased from 32,000km to 34,000km, emitting 5.98 tonnes of carbon - a 16 per cent increase on last year.
Rental car use had doubled from 1500km to 3000km with emissions of 0.73 tonnes from 0.36 tonnes. Taxi use was up to 1500km from 1000km, with emissions of 0.48 tonnes, up from 0.32 tonnes - a 50 per cent increase.
Electricity use also increased, from 49,000kWh to 52,000kWh, however the commissioner, Jan Wright, said changes to calculations meant tonnes emitted had fallen from 10.15 to 8.63 tonnes, a fall of 15 per cent.
The report did not explain how using more electricity meant a reduction in carbon emissions, but noted: "The conversion tables provided by the Minister of the Environment were changed since 2007, accounting for the decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted although there was an increase in actual electricity use".
Because of the change, the commissioner said the overall tonnes of carbon emitted fell 0.15 per cent from 15.97 to 15.82 tonnes.
