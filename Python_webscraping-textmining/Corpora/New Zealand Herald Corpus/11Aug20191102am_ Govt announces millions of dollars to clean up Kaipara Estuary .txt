The Government is pouring millions of dollars into fencing and riparian planting along the Kaipara Estuary to protect it from pollution, including from livestock faeces.
The work is part of the broader Government aim to clean up rivers and lakes, for which Budget 2019 set aside $229 million to improve land use and waterways.
