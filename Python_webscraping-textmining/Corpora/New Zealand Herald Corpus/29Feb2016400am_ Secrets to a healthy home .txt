• The south side of the house is designed to keep cold air out, hence the envelope effect. Roof overhangs and slatted screens prevent summer overheating but allow low altitude winter sun to penetrate deep into the building.
• Renewable New Zealand Radiata Pine is used for all walls, floor and roof framing, and ceilings. The weatherboards are a patented Lockwood quarter-sawn glue laminated Radiata Pine product which gives stability, durability and a lower environmental footprint. Another alternative is Lockwood's cedar cladding option.
• Similarly the north-facing 'beak' allows for solar photovoltaic cells for electricity generation.
