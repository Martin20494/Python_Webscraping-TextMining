Riparian areas, or waterway margins, are the strip of land that runs alongside waterways. If you have any waterways on your land, managing your riparian areas is something to consider. It may take a bit of work up front, but it can have benefits for your land, your livestock, and for the surrounding area's environment. Farmer can now deduct the expense of riparian planting as an operational expense.
