A businessman targeted by a group of protesters who allege his development company is polluting an Auckland marine reserve says the group is "dangerously wrong" and Auckland Council says the site is operating to "a high standard".
"During recent extreme weather events, the streams in the catchment above the development became a dirty yellow colour. Natural slips which occurred following extreme rainfall contributed to this."
Reid, who has lived next to the marine reserve in north Auckland for most of his life, said he believed Williams was "ignoring our community's pleas to stop the destruction of the local environment".
Reid said the group's protest "isn't just a one-off".
