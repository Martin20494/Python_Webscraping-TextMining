About a month ago, I couldn't find my credit card when I arrived at the checkout at Pak'n Save Royal Oak. I had some cash but I was $14 short. The man behind me in the queue produced his credit card and paid the deficit on my account. I thanked him profusely and gave him my address but I have heard no more.


Loud music in shops - why does it have to be so intrusive? I vote with my feet and walk out.


Frolicking lambs with waggling tails, calves blinking sleepily in the sun, tui gorging themselves on kowhai flowers. Families picnicking under the cherry blossoms. The deep blue carpet of bluebells on Twin Oak Drive, and the vivid green of oak in bud. You can't beat Cornwall Park in spring.


I agree with Ann Mark on Thursday about the use of black polystyrene trays by supermarkets. And what about the millions of plastic bags that aren't recyclable that are clogging up our landfills and polluting rivers and seas? What happened to the good old paper bags that are recyclable and can probably be re-manufactured from the same material over and over again. I spent many years in Sub-Saharan Africa and whatever country you go to has thousands of miles of fences covered in plastic bags. We don't want to end up like that.


This is my favourite time of the year -- the Auckland Heritage Festival. Every year I think I've done so much there won't be anything left to see, but there is! I just love learning about Auckland history. Top marks to the volunteers and their stories and thanks to Auckland Council for this amazing two weeks.


As a woman, being addressed as "you guys" is not only patently absurd but also maddening in its acceptance without challenge. Imagine a group of men and women being addressed as "you gals" without an outburst of laughter or derision.
