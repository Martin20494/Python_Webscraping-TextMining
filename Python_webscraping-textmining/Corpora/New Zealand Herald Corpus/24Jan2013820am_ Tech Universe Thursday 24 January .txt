Backpacks on mussels? Researchers at the University of Iowa attached
to Mississippi river mussels that measure how open their shells are. Data is sent to a station on shore that relays it to a lab for analysis. Mussels change how open their shells are in response to water conditions. That data could help scientists monitor water quality, including factors like varying nitrogen levels and pollutants. One reason for using mussels is that they keep themselves clean, so the monitors could last for years. Mussels that pack a punch.
