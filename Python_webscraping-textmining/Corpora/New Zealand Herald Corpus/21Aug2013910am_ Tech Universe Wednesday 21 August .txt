Every day there are more devices and gadgets available to us that do interesting or useful things. Every device needs a source of power though, so battery technology is also continuously developing. Now engineers at the University of Washington have created a wireless communication system that enables devices to interact with each other
or cables for power. The ambient
reflects existing cellular and TV signals already in the air. Antennas detect, harness and reflect a TV signal, which is then picked up by other similar devices. That means a whole a network of devices and sensors could communicate without a battery in sight. One application could be sensors monitoring a bridge or other structure that could send an alert back to base. I bet someone's going to claim they own those ambient RF signals and start charging for their use.
