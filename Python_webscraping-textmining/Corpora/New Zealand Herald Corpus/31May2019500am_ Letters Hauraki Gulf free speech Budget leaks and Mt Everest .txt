One key policy proposal is to massively extend Marine Reserves (now called Marine Protected Areas or MPAs). I am a keen recreational fisherman and concerned this will prevent access for fishing in some highly valued fishing areas.
The idea is being promoted that MPAs will increase fish life enough to justify the loss of fishing areas; but this is not true, as most of the increase in fish will be within MPAs and any spill over to other areas will not be enough to equal the loss of prime fishing places.

For example, total electrification of the main trunk line by 2022. That's three years to get a fleet of modern electric locomotives carrying freight and passengers between Wellington and Auckland.
Burning diesel when electricity runs on a dedicated line directly above a dedicated rail is just plain silly.
