Wairarapa needs to clean up its act when it comes to air pollution - even though smog levels in the district are not as dire as places elsewhere in the country.
Wairarapa trails a field, alongside Putaruru in Waikato, of 13 regions throughout the country that have each year on average breached air quality standards more than once.
Heading that group is Rangiora and Waimate in Canterbury, that have on a yearly average crossed the line seven times apiece over the same period.
Regional councils across the country police and record air pollution standards and were tasked in 2004 with reducing smog levels. Smog peaks mostly in winter due to inefficient woodburners and hearth fires.
He extended the compliance timeframe to achieve not more than a single breach a year from 2013 to 2016 for areas with moderate air pollution - including Wairarapa - and set an extension to 2020 at the same target level for regions with higher air pollution counts. Dr Smith also set a secondary requirement for the smoggier regions to get below three breaches by 2016.
"We need to replace our old and open domestic fires, invest in cleaner technology in our factories and continue to shift to modern low-polluting vehicles.
"Change is needed because Labour's 2004 policy was poorly implemented, unrealistic and unfair.
"The blunt enforcement provision only penalises industry, prohibiting new or existing industrial consents being renewed, and puts at risk an estimated 17,000 jobs."
"This reflects the lesser costs of achieving the improvements in air quality over a more realistic timetable.
The revamped policy comes in the wake of concerns raised at the 2009 Job Summit, the Technical Advisory Group report in late 2008, and the consultation on the draft changes in 2010, he said.
