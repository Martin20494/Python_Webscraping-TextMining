New rules have been announced today for how Aucklanders can use their indoor fires.
The bylaw also bans some materials from being burned in indoor fires, to minimise smoke and contaminants being released into the air.
It was the council's responsibility to make sure national air quality standards established by the Government were met, Sinclair said.
"We no longer have the environmental factors demanding the strict rules for indoor fires that were suggested in 2014, but we do need some rules in order to maintain good air quality and keep building on the improvements in recent years."
For anyone considering a new indoor fire this winter, the most environmentally-friendly types are gas fireplaces, enclosed wood burners that meet the national wood burner standards or other types of solid-fuel indoor fireplaces that meet emission standards in the draft bylaw, such as pellet burners, Sinclair said.
