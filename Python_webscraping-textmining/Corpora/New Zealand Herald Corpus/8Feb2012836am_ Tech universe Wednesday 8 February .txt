So after you've 3D printed a bunch of handy stuff for around the home what next? Well, one 83 year old got herself a new jaw from a 3D printer. At the University of Hasselt in Belgium a team quickly printed a new jaw using layers of titanium powder correctly fused together by a computer controlled laser. Then the jaw was finished with a bioceramic coating. It's slightly heavier than a standard jaw but the patient was talking and swallowing the day after the surgery. The operation itself took four hours rather than 20, and the patient was able to go home after four days rather than the usual four weeks. If the jaw's titanium I guess the false teeth will be securely screwed in. More details
