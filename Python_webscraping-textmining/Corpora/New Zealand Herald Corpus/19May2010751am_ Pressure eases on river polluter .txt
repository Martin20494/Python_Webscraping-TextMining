Charges that would force Carterton's biggest company to pay for its polluting have been staggered after receiving a negative reaction from the firm.
The charges, which were to have been introduced in full in July last year, were deferred after discussions with the firm.
The charges are being staggered over three years, with the company paying one-third this financial year, two-thirds in the next, and the full charges for discharging nitrogen and phosphorous in 2012-13 under the council's trade waste bylaw.
Discharges from the company contribute about 30 per cent of the nutrient loads of Carterton's waste system, which discharges into the Mangatarere stream.
Mangatarere valley resident Graham Ross said the treatment plant was a major polluter in the area although he couldn't comment
But Mr Ross was concerned about the quality of the river and said that when water levels were low he understood it ranked as one of the most polluted in New Zealand.
''They have to weigh up the contribution that Premier Bacon makes to the community _ jobs and the like and how this has gone
''In situations like this one, there's a balance that can be struck with what is practically possible and what is desirable, and my sense is that we tend to be very lenient when it comes to the protection of the environment.'' Manager of Premier Bacon's Carterton factory Greg Martin said he was not authorised to comment.
