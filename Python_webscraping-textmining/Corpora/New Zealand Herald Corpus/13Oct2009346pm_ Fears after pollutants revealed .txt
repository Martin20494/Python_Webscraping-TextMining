Potentially deadly substances including cyanide are included in a list of confirmed pollutants at 11 contamination sites across Wairarapa.
The list compiles activities and industries considered likely to cause land contamination resulting from hazardous substance use, storage or disposal and also includes around 400 sites across Wairarapa with a "verified history of hazardous activity or industry" coupled with cleaned up sites of "acceptably managed and remediated contamination."
Assignment to the "verified history" category does not necessarily mean the site is contaminated, just that hazardous substances have been used, stored or disposed of on the site and there is potential for site contamination.
A site classified as "contamination acceptable, managed/remediated" is one where clear evidence of residues of hazardous substances exist above background concentrations but the level of risk of adverse effects on human health or the environment is shown to be acceptable for the particular land use.
Mr ten Hove said any land use changes at the old gasworks would be managed depending on the nature of future use and balanced alongside the potential for exposure to contaminants.
He said the letters stimulated interest amongst site owners and resulted in GWRC uncovering new information to add to the register.
Other sites of confirmed contamination in the region include various defunct and existing service stations, landfills, gasworks and timber treatment sites.
The HAIL register has been maintained by GWRC as a service to the three Wairarapa councils since 1996 and Mr Taylor said none of the 11 confirmed contamination sites was a new addition to the updated register.
