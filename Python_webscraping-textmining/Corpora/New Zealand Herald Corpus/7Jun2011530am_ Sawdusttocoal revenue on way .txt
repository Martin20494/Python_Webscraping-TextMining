Blenheim's Carbonscape, which has developed a one-step process to turn sawmill waste into pure coal and other valuable materials, is developing its technology to manufacture products at commercial volumes.
Nick Gerritsen, co-founder of the clean-tech outfit, says the four-year-old company may be about 12 months away from its first revenues.
Carbonscape's industrial microwave heats waste at up to 3000C, creating a process called pyrolysisation.
"Pyrolysis basically creates three product sets - we get charcoal or carbon, bio oil and syngas," he said.
Gerritsen said Carbonscape's focus was on producing carbon products, used by many billion dollar industries around the world.
One of those products, activated carbon, could be used to filter water or soak up polluting industrial waste gases, and sold for up to US$5000 ($6120) a tonne, he said.
Gerritsen said the process could also turn pine sawdust into anthracite coal, an extremely pure form of the mineral used in steel production.
"Effectively we've created an equivalent to coking coal out of sawdust," he said.
Gerritsen said similar processes under development around the world required up to 10 steps to create value-added products, as well as "exotic feedstocks" such as coconut shells.
"What we've done is create a one-step process," he said, adding that Carbonscape's technology could use a range of feedstocks, including waste corncobs.
