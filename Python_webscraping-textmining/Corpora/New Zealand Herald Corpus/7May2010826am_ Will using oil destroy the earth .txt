Why is it whenever I write a blog about the environment, be it global warming or the pollution, it draws such fiercely irrational comments?
Some of the comments that appeared after I wrote about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill the other day sounded as if I am pro-destroying the earth. Good grief - polluting the planet is something that humans, and all animals for that matter, need to do to survive.
The human race discovered Australia about 50,000 years ago... they didn't arrive there because they were bored. Most likely, they arrived there because they had eaten and pillaged the land behind them and so continued to walk further along the coastline from Africa...eventually reaching Australia, by boat for the last couple of hundred kilometres. Again, it's quite likely they left East Timor for Australia in search of food and a better life, as they had exhausted the resources along their travels.
In the year 2010 life is still somewhat similar. To survive in this brutal economy oil is a practical commodity. And just like our ancestors, once it's gone, we will move on to the next resource.
We are not necessarily smarter these days either. Most scientists believed that our 50,000 year old ancestors had incredible skills in nature... they could taste the salt water at sea and know if land was nearby. Certain clouds in the sky would indicate a distant landmass beyond the horizon...and possibly smells in the air helped them work out other landscape opportunities.
Humans now a days are 'dumber' in the sense that we rely on computers, books and other people to tell us how to work things out. We don't rely on our gut instinct as much.
Is Oil ideal? No. Is Coal ideal? No. Is it a fact of life for us now? Yes. And will us using it destroy earth - no way.
