The giant kauri at the centre of a protest in West Auckland will be allowed to stay.
2. Let's turn these two sites from a place of conflict and division to a place of hope, a place to come together and plan a different future.
4. Let's build on these sites as we need to keep property law intact and create homes. Our NZ is about family and community and nature. Can we try and have it all with small compromises?
If we throw out the current rules we could do something a lot better than where we had got to with these houses.
7. Let's allow Treescape and Vector, iwi and council to own the sites on the public's behalf and let's forgive them too. Give them a chance to try something new and create something better from this current mess. The compromise is they have to work together as a team and communicate quickly and professionally.
We hope everyone can support this, because then it will be the best 20th wedding anniversary!
