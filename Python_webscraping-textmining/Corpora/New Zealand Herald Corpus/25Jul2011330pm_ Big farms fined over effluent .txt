An award-winning Northland dairy farmer is facing three charges of discharging dairy farm effluent into waterways.
Environment Court Judge Gordon Whiting earlier ordered Mr Flood to submit proper financial statements before sentencing would proceed.
Mr Flood is a large-scale dairy farmer and milks 3600 cows on 1230ha of properties at Ruawai, Kerikeri and Kai Iwi Lakes, and also mentors young farmers.
Mr Flood has farmed in Ruawai since 1991 buying further properties during the ensuing years.
He visits each weekly, flying his Foxton Terrain two-seater aircraft to Kerikeri and Kai Iwi. Mr Flood was born and raised at Awanui, where his farming father passed on his considerable farming knowledge and skills.
The survey, based on test results collected by the NRC, shows only 43 per cent of dairy farms in Northland fully comply with effluent discharge conditions of their resource consent, up on the 39 per cent the previous year, but the second-worst rate in the country.
Anthony Joseph Schluter of Pekerau and James Dodunski of JKD Farms, appeared for sentencing in an Environment Court in Whangarei. JKD Farms was charged with two counts of discharging farm dairy effluent into separate tributaries and Schluter faced a single charge. Dodunski was fined $26,000 and Schluter $25,000.
