In 2009, I worked as a volunteer for 8 months with local communities in the Ha'apai Islands of Tonga. We motivated over 3,000 locals (from a total population of 4,500) to remove 50 tonnes of rubbish in a one-day island-wide clean-up.
Last night the New Zealand whale watching industry and conservationist groups got the welcome news that the International Court of Justice in the Hague has ordered Japan to stop whaling in the Southern Ocean.
