Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla founder, invests in cars, rockets and tunnels and hopes to colonise Mars, but he has one venture that he has kept secret at his SpaceX campus.
Musk founded the experimental school three years ago to "exceed traditional school metrics on all relevant subject matter through unique project-based learning experiences", according to a regulatory filing document discovered by the tech website Ars Technica.
Ad Astra has been kept secret as a mostly private venture. It educates children aged from 7 to 14 and started with a class of eight, including Musk's children. It has grown to around 40 students made up of gifted applicants and the children of SpaceX employees.
"We take the most precocious kid we can find who can keep up with kids who are a bit older," said Dahn, who described one problem-solving exercise, called "The Lake", which involves students discussing a town with a factory that is polluting the local water and killing wildlife.
