If you're going to blow yourself up deliberately then I guess you want to choose the time and place.

Princeton University engineers can create a laser beam out of thin air. An ultraviolet laser pulse focuses on a tiny patch of air exciting oxygen atoms. When the pulse ends electrons fall and create a coherent laser beam aimed right back at the original laser. Analysis of the return beam could indicate even trace amounts of pollutants in the air, such as explosives or hazardous gases. I can imagine detectors for bad breath, booze breath and garlic breath.

Log in over the web to change settings. All data that would very much interest advertisers too, I'm sure. More at
