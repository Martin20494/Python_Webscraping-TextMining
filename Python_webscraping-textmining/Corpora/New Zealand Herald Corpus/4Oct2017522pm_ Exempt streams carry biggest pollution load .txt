More than three quarters of pollution flowing into our freshwater catchments comes through small streams that currently aren't required to be fenced off, a just-published study has shown.
"Fencing is very effective at reducing contaminant loads to waterways - by 10 to 90 per cent depending on the nature of the contaminants and local issues," McDowell said.
"Fencing works especially well for the likes of E.coli or phosphorus contamination that can result from animal waste or stream bank destabilisation."
"A combination of better awareness of the issues and the use of good management practices - including fencing - in the right place is starting to reverse degrading trends in the likes of phosphorus and sediment in the water over the last decade."
Dairy farmers had invested in a major programme of fencing waterways to the equivalent of nearly 27,000km.
"The fact that most of the contaminant load comes from areas not requiring fencing reflects the much greater number and areas occupied by small streams - potentially from steeper country where dairy farming is unlikely to be present.
