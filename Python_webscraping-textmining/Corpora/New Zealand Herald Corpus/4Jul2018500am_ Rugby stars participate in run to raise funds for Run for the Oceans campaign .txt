Rugby stars Tyla Nathan Wong and Israel Dagg have been out doing their part to save the environment, taking part in Adidas' global Run for the Oceans campaign.
The design company has teamed up with Parley to intercept ocean plastic and redesign them into materials the company can use in their products.
In 2017, Adidas created one million products using Parley plastic, and has made a commitment to creating five million products this year.
Run for the Oceans is a campaign in which for every kilometre run this July, Adidas will donate $1 to Parley to help clean the oceans of the world.
• There's enough plastic in the ocean to circle the earth 425 times
• Experts believe that by 2050 there's going to be more plastic in our oceans than fish
• Plastic takes anywhere from 500 to 1000 years to break down, which means virtually every piece of plastic ever made still exists in some form. Loads of it is polluting our waters and killing marine wildlife
• If our oceans can't function properly, they won't be able to support fish stocks, absorb carbon to protect us against global warming or generally do any of the things that our lives are dependent on.
