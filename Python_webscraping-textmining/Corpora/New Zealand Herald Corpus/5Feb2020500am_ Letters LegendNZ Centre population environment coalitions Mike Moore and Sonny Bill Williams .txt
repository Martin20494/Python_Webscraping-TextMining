Regrettably, some people have cherry-picked from the comprehensive LegendNZ Centre proposal to make it sound as though it would be some kind of shrine for misogynists, jingoists and reactionaries. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Legendary New Zealanders are to be one of the key drawcards but the purpose is not to idolise them, but rather to learn from them and be inspired.

Europe, population 720m, has a growth rate of 0.3 per cent and most of this is due to either current immigration or immigrant birth rates (also dropping) i.e. generally, the EU is also aging population â€“ as are Korea and Japan.
Looking at South America; for example, the population growth rate of Brazil fell from 2.6 per cent in 1969 to 0.8 per cent in 2018. Nowadays, in South America, only Bolivia has a population growth rate above 1 per cent. The Falkland Islands, Guyana and Uruguay are at a 0 per cent growth rate. Africa is following a similar trend, although lagging by 20 years. Space precludes me from further exposition, e.g. NZ.
It is unlikely the world population will ever reach the UN prediction of 11.2b in 2100. UN departments are funded according to perceived "relevance and need" - maybe that is why the elephant has not been recently spotted.
