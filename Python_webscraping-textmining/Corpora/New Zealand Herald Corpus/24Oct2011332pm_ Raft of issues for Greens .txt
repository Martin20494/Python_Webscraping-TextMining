Green Party co-leader Russel Norman continued his Dirty Rivers Rafting Tour on Friday by checking out the state of the Ruamahanga River.
They stopped at key spots, such as where the Makoura Stream flows into the river, to view the pollution.
He said the goal of the trip was to get out and see the state the rivers were in, and put pressure on the Government to sign off the Draft National Policy Statement on Fresh Water Management.
"Most of the pollution is from the intensification of agriculture - the levels of nitrogen getting into the rivers has increased significantly," Mr Norman said. "It's down to bad councils and bad farmers. Good farmers and good councils have nothing to fear."
Wellington Fish and Game environmental officer Corina Jordan said she was pleased to see such a diverse group of people with a broad range of values on the trip.
"The river is in a poor state and that is caused by a number of human activities and we all need to start taking ownership of these issues and be a part of the solution as a community."
"We could clean it up now, but there is no political will, so the community is going to suffer in the short and long term."
He said the rivers were "the last of the wild places on the plains", and if something was not done soon, future generations would not be able to use them.
