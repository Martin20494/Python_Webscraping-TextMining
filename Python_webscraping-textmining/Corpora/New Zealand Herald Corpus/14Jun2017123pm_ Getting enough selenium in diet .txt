Selenium is a mineral used by our bodies and the earth. Unfortunately, however, it is deficient in most New Zealand soils, as well as areas of other countries, including in China and America.
Antioxidants neutralise free radicals, helping to prevent many serious, modern diseases.
Due to its antioxidant properties, selenium is helpful to:
¦ Help with health problems, such as psoriasis, eczema, alcoholism, infections and cataracts.
¦ Prevent cellular degeneration and aging (especially enhanced by vitamin E).
¦ Help protect from toxic effects of heavy metals and pollutants, such as those found in some drinking water, cigarettes and alcohol.
The level of selenium in our diet depends directly on the selenium levels in the soil where the plants we eat are grown, and the plants in which the animals we eat are grown. Selenium can be added to your vegetable garden by using fish compost and seaweed.
Food sources of selenium include;
¦ Shellfish - especially scallops, shrimps and oysters.
¦ Liver, butter and lamb - contain adequate amounts.
¦ Garlic, onions, mushrooms, broccoli, tomatoes, radishes - these are all good sources, as long as selenium is in the soil in which they are grown.
