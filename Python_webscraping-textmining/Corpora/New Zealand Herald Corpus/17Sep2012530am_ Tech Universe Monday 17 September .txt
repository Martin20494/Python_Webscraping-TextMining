Nicotine patches use small hydrophobic molecules that can be absorbed through the skin. Many drugs though, such as those for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders, have large molecules that won't pass through the skin so can't be delivered through a patch. But researchers at Purdue University think that fermentation may be the answer. They've created a new patch that includes yeast, sugar and water and a small membrane that separates that mix from the drug. Body heat causes the ingredients to ferment, creating CO2 that puts pressure on the membrane and pumps the drug through painless microneedles with a diameter of about 20 microns. The system doesn't need a battery, as body heat supplies the energy. Using the patch would just require adding water and applying the patch to the skin. Nifty.
