There's no light rail to "expand". At this point we have only heavy rail and buses.
Part of the confusion that Barney talks about comes from the loose use of the words "rapid transit" without actually defining what these words mean.
I suspect this is because the authorities simply don't want to spend the money on one proper integrated system, running along dedicated corridors, as does the existing heavy electric rail.
