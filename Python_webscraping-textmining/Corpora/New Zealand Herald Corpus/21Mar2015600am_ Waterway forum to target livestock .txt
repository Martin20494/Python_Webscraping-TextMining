A meeting will be held in Carterton on Monday night to discuss options around preventing livestock from polluting waterways.
Submissions on the Greater Wellington Regional Council's draft Natural Resources Plan closed at the end of last year and the council received more than 50 comments on the issue.
Some people and organisations sought minor changes to the provisions in the draft plan, others sought a major re-think.
Because the draft rules around livestock access to water bodies would require a change for many landowners, a focus group was formed made up of representatives from key organisations and landowners who commented on the draft plan.
It found in order to protect the region's lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands from livestock damage, an all-out effort would be required by landowners, councils and the community.
The group has been working through what activities could be permitted and where, what activities are likely to need resource consent and what assistance could be provided to help with costs of fencing, planting and pest control.
It has identified alternative approaches to be presented to Te Upoko Taiao " Natural Resource Management Committee, the group overseeing the plan, and the public is invited to presentations in Carterton, Wainuiomata and Otaki. The meeting is on Monday, March 23, 7.30pm to 9pm, at the Carterton Events Centre.
