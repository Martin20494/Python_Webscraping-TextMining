"If you don't do something about the sheep and beef farmers who are letting stock do what they like up there in the hills, you're going to have a serious battle on your hands," one farmer told staff from Horizons Regional Council.
Oneplan combines the Manawatu-Wanganui region's resource management plans into a single document covering the next 10 years.
They are aimed at controlling the leaching of pollutants from the soil into streams.
Preparing the report could cost between $1500 and $5000, besides the cost of any mitigation measures.
Yesterday was the first of several farm open days around the Manawatu-Wanganui area, to inform farmers of the proposed detail and get feedback ahead of Oneplan hearings.
Open day host farmers Jim and Lynette Galloway were said to be an exceptional case, mainly because they were in a high rainfall area that leads to more leaching from the soil.
"We went in to be as open and honest as we can on it," Mr Galloway said.
Another major cost was the recommendation the Galloway's graze off farm over winter.
"I don't know what the difference is between grazing them here and grazing at a sheep farm down the road.
There would be no vote, Oneplan implementation manager Peter Taylor told one farmer, explaining that only those who had made submissions on the Oneplan process could present evidence at the hearings.
Someone asked the managers: "When you go back to your office, what will you take out of this (meeting)?"
He also said however, "there doesn't seem to be a general acceptance that we've got a serious problem out there".
"We know that dairy farmers are leaching a lot more than the intensive livestock farmers."
