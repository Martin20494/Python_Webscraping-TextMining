Wellington ducks are swimming in polluted waters as homeowners make the most of the recent fine weather to paint their homes.
Botanic Garden Manager David Sole said at this time of year he receives reports of discolouration in the Botanic Garden duck pond.
"The pond gets its water from stormwater drains in Northland and Kelburn - prime areas for summer house-painting," Mr Sole said.
"We think a lot of the discolouration is due to paint or dust entering the stormwater system. It's vital people are aware what goes down the drain ends up straight in our streams, ponds and harbour. It's distressing for children and visitors to the garden to see ducks swimming in polluted water - and the ducks don't like it either."
Mr Sole said it is an offence to put anything other than rainwater down the drain.
