There are more than 2500 varieties of seaweed, which includes everything from algae that forms on ponds to kelp and other marine plants.
Seaweed products have been used by many people for generations including Celts, Polynesians, Europeans, Asians and the indigenous people of the Americas. Sea vegetables not only offer us an opportunity to improve general health, but also those in the best of health can benefit by their daily consumption.
Sea vegetables are generally more nutritious than land based vegetables and can be up to 20 times richer in minerals, contain a wide range of vitamins and all eight essential amino acids and they have low levels of fat.
Some also supply beta carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, vitamins C and K, the B vitamins and protein. Many provide a wide range of other vitamins and minerals, such as phosphorus, manganese, zinc and trace minerals.
Another advantageous characteristic of sea vegetables are their radio-protective properties. There is no family of foods more protective against radiation and environmental pollutants than sea vegetables. The alginic acid found in sea vegetation acts as a binding or chelating agent in the body, and therefore binds to radiation found within the digestive tract. It is also thought to extract and chelate it from the bone marrow and bloodstream.
Obviously this makes it even more important that the seaweed you are eating has been collected from clean, pollutant free waters.
As some seaweed contains high levels of sodium, individuals on limited salt diets need to tread with care.
