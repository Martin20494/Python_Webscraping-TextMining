Greytown conservationist Alan Wilde, who spoke out about cattle polluting the Ruamahanga River, was "delighted" this week to find Greater Wellington Regional Council has acted to solve the problem.
On a fishing trip to Kahutara, Mr Wilde found the regional council, which owns the land, had responded to publicity over cattle having unfettered access to the water and fenced it off.
"They have done a really good job," Mr Wilde said.
"The posts are high quality and they have run a hot wire along the entire length, I was delighted to see they have done a really professional job."
Mr Wilde spoke out earlier this year over farmers who lease land from the council allowing stock to enter the water and defecate in it.
He called on council to show leadership by putting a stop to the practice that contravenes clean water accords and environmental laws.
The land in question borders the Ruamahanga from the East-West access road and Mr Wilde said now cattle have been excluded from the river, a large cattle trough has been installed.
Mr Wilde said it appeared some fencing had also been done, perhaps by the leasee, to exclude cattle from the outflow from the floodgates.
"Now it remains for the public to play their part and ensure the gates and electric fence entrances are kept closed when they go down to the river."
But Mr Wilde said the situation didn't appear as rosy when he looked across to the other side of the river though.
"A month or so ago I saw a herd of black aberdeen angus cattle wading into the water from that side.
Fonterra's general manager of milk supply, Steve Murphy, said this week results of a Fonterra clean streams accord survey showed progress with a need for more to be done.
Mr Murphy said "stock exclusion" was important for waterway health.
Fonterra was requiring milk suppliers to have "remaining waterways fenced off by the end of 2013 at the latest". "This will be a condition of supply," Mr Murphy said.
