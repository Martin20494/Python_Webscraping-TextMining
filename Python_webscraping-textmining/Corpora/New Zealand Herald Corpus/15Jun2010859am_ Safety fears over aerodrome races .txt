Aviators are frustrated by the closing of Hood Aerodrome to make way for motorplex races and say there needs to be more concern
Mrs Turner said the aerodrome was an airport and ''should be treated as such''.
She said if anyone needed an example of what happened when debris interfered with airplanes they should look at the Concorde plane crash in France 10 years ago where during take-off a passenger plane lost a titanium part, which ruptured a tyre that burst, damaging a fuel tank which was then ignited by the plane's electrical unit.
Aviators who pay fees to use the airport were frustrated they could not use it whenever they wanted to because motorplex events forced the airport to close, Mrs Turner said.
Mrs Turner said at some point the Life Flight Trust had needed to bring in their helicopter to fly a sick person to another hospital.
The helicopter crew were asked if they could land on the grass and they said it would cause damage to their machine so after some insistence, the runway was cleared.
''Plane users pay for the right to use the airport and they can't go anywhere else to do so, they need the air strip,'' she said.
She said she wondered if the Government would begin taxing the motorplex for polluting like they would tax anyone else for it.
