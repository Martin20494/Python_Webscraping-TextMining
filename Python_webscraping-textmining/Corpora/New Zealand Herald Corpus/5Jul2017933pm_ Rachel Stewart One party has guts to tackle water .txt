Nobody owns water, right? Wrong.
The fund Rachel refers to, the Irrigation Acceleration Fund, does not pay for large scale infrastructure. It pays up to 50 per cent grant funding for water management studies that investigate win-win scenarios for local communities - improving freshwater management (with a particular focus on resolving over allocation), alongside the development of water infrastructure. It has $25 million dollars available for this in the period 2015-2018.
The other fund is Crown Irrigation Investments who do provide funding for large scale infrastructure, all of which (apart from some initial scoping activity) has to be paid back by farmers with interest. To date, two investments have been made totalling $72.5m. The government has committed 'up to $400m' but this money has not been spent. We are not aware of any more funding that is 'to come'.
