Well-meaning Wairarapa people could be sending toxic clouds into the atmosphere, inadvertently polluting our air by incorrectly running their woodburners.
Moreover, the research shows that the way wood burners are operated is just as important as the substance being burned, with high-tech modern burners often more guilty than older models in terms of pollution.
"We've got some burners that are, at best, belching out a lot of crap because people aren't operating them properly. In reality it may be that people simply aren't capable of operating them properly, so there might need to be some [directives] around how best to use them."
"Often the bigger ones never get run at full capacity because you couldn't do so without having to open up the windows because of the heat."
Mr Bluett recommended pellet burners because of their efficiency, but admitted the price of the fuel coupled with an abundance of wood in Wairarapa meant they were not widely used.
Air quality is monitored by Greater Wellington Regional Council at its Wairarapa College site, where it tests for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and particulates. If particulate levels reach more than 50 micrograms per cubic metre of air, that constitutes a breach of the air-quality standard.
