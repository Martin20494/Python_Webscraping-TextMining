It's not exactly a plane, although it looks like one. The
from Hawkes Ocean Technologies is a 2 or 3 person electric submersible. It's 6.4 metres long and up to 2.7 metres wide, depending on whether the wings are folded or not. It cruises at up to 6 knots and can descend to 120 metres. The sub operates on the same principles as aircraft, and is always buoyant so it'll return to the surface rather than sinking if everything is turned off. Oh, and you can launch the sub from your yacht, so that's handy.
