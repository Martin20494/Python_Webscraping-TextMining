Cane toads could become even more deadly because of their exposure to a common weedkiller, scientists say.
New research carried out in Hungary has found that when toad tadpoles come into contact with the widely used weedkiller Glyphogan their bodies produce more of the toxic chemicals they use to ward off predators.
The scientists behind the research say their findings, published by The Royal Society, suggest that cane toads in Australia could become more toxic given they come into contact with various pollutants and pesticides because they live in such a wide variety of habitats.
