Green campaigner Sting has confessed his carbon footprint is "massive" and he has admitted slashing the number of air-polluting long-haul flights will not reverse climate change.
The former The Police frontman has spent 20 years campaigning on environmental issues and promoting drives to save rainforests for the sake of the planet.
But now he has admitted urging travellers to cut down on the number of flights they take is pointless - because until the rainforest issues are solved, global warming will continue.
"Well that's the narrative (of my critics): venal celebrities preaching to the world about climate change. The fact is none of us can help but do the wrong thing. I'm assuming you didn't come here on a donkey, right? Tomorrow, I'm going to get on a plane and go to another city and admittedly my carbon footprint is massive," the rocker tells Britain's
"At the same time, I say we shouldn't rip up the forest because if you read the Stern report (the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change), all of us could stop travelling tomorrow, industry could stop tomorrow, but the largest contribution to global warming is deforestation - by a huge, huge amount.
"So until we do that, we might as well just carry on."
