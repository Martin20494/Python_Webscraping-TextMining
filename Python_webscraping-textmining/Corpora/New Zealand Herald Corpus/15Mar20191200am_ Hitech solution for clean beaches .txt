Charity Group Sustainable Coastlines has collected around 1.5 million litres of rubbish from our beaches in the past decade â€“ but the scale of the problem is such that new approaches to cleaning up our coastlines are needed.
Sustainable Coastlines is developing a national litter database and education programme that will produce the right data and insights to help reduce waste and keep our beaches litter-free, the way they should be.
