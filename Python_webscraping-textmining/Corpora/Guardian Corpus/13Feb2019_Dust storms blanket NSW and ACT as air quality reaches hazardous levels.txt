As government scientists in NSW confirmed December and January as the stateâ€™s dustiest ever, millions of people woke on Wednesday to find a reddish hue in the morning sky and cars coated in dust.
The dust cloud stretched 1,500km from western NSW to the ocean, reaching

A dust storm is expected to hit Sydney later this evening.

PM10 particles are those less than 10 micrometers in diameter, which are small enough to enter into the lungs and can cause serious health problems including asthma and heart and lung problems.
However, a southerly wind was expected to blow the dust away from the 
The dust storm followed another hot day across eastern Australia on Tuesday with temperatures reaching the mid-30s in Sydney and coastal areas and into the low 40s in some parts further inland.
Dust storms are caused when strong winds lift loose earth and sand from arid landscapes and deposit them high in the atmosphere. The dust is then caught up in cold fronts and dumped back on the land.
Luckily the pilot was really comforting ahead of the landing. '60kmph winds from the west, zero visibility, and a dust storm. It'll be a bit bumpy.'
A spokesperson for the NSW office of environment and heritage said December and January had been the dustiest on record. December had 23 hours of dust, which is defined as visibility less than 10km, while January had an average of 38 hours of dust across its 21 stations in western NSW.
The DustWatch project has 36 stations across NSW and a few in SA and Victoria. The aim is to measure the extent and severity of wind erosion. Wind erosion is the major cause of dust storms. Wind erosion reduces the soils productivity and dust storms impact the community via air pollution
