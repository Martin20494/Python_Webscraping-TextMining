There are alternatives that are safe in the environment and, when tested, equally good at repelling water, orange juice and red wine. But some manufacturers appear reluctant to use them. The researchers make the point that the only people who really need clothing that keeps out oil and bodily fluids as well as water are the emergency services. They need to keep using protective clothing that contains these chemicals but the rest of us do not. The researchers also point out that this is no small matter since the textile and clothing industry uses a quarter of all the chemicals produced globally. The chemicals get into the environment when clothes are washed and fibres are shed. Scientists are calling for better labelling so consumers can choose a raincoat that keeps them dry without contributing to contaminating the planet.
