Point Nemo.
First discovered in 1992 by survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela.
 A load of water, surrounded by even more water.
 I wouldn’t bother: the trip would involve a tremendous amount of effort for very little in the way of return.
 It’s officially the oceanic pole of inaccessibility.
It’s the spot in the ocean farthest away from land in any direction – in effect, the middle of nowhere.
 Point Nemo is located at 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W, more than 1,600km away from three equidistant islands, including Easter Island.
So much so that often the closest humans to Point Nemo are aboard the International Space Station.
 Not really. It sits within a current called the South Pacific Gyre, which steers away nutrient-rich waters, making it one of the most lifeless parts of the ocean.
Yes. 
 Up to 
No. Lukatela “found” Point Nemo not by visiting, but by calculating its position using computer software. It’s just general plastic.
 I’m afraid so, although not as polluted as, say, the South China Sea, where they found 357 particles per cubic metre.
It’s home to a loud, ultra-low frequency noise known as 
Because of its remoteness, the surrounding water is where falling satellites are directed. The ocean floor round there is littered with space debris.
Maybe, but think of the shipping costs.
“This sad discovery shows the need for immediate international action on microplastics.”
 “One star. Zero amenities, miles from anywhere. The plastic was the best bit. We won’t be visiting again.”
