in Delhi has hit 18 times the healthy limit and left the city under a thick, toxic haze after Diwali was celebrated with a night of fireworks – despite a court-ordered ban on their sales.

However many still lit fireworks across the city late into the night, either using old stock or buying them from neighbouring states.

 An index of air quality had crossed the hazardous limit of 300 on Friday, the most severe level on a US embassy scale of measurement, which rates a reading of 50 as good and anything above that as a cause for concern.
 Some parts of Delhi, such as Mandir Marg, showed an air quality reading of 941, close to the maximum of 999, beyond which no readings are available. The index measures concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide, among other indicators.
When air quality reaches a hazardous level, people may experience ill effects and are advised to stay indoors.
Apart from the firecracker ban, the supreme court also ordered diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down to try to reduce pollution. The Environment 
 Dipankar Saha, a scientist at the Central Pollution Control Board, said the still weather had also played a part in the toxic haze hanging over the city.

 “It was going to be hard to beat last year’s level in any case,” he said.
