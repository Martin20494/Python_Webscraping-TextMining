is familiar with playing malevolent creatures that lurk in the darkness, so it is perhaps fitting that the Lord of the Rings actor is now raising awareness about the unsightly horrors that lie in the UK’s sewers.
A new campaign is warning against flushing wet wipes down the toilet. It turns out that the “fatbergs” clogging up our city sewers actually consist of just 0.5% fat and 93% wet wipes. Perhaps we should be calling them “wipebergs”.
A short animated film stars Serkis as a talking anus, highlighting the damaging impact of our addiction to wet wipes and calling for the public to “be a good a**hole” and dispose of them responsibly.
Campaigns to educate people about how not to feed fatbergs take pains to remind us that toilets and sinks are not “magic portals”. There is a simple set of rules for the bathroom: stick to flushing the three Ps: pee, poo and (toilet) paper. Everything else – sanitary towels, nappies, cotton buds, condoms, dental floss, used plasters and whatever else you might think to chuck down the toilet – should go into the bin.
Just because a product says it is flushable doesn’t mean that it is biodegradable. Baby wipes might be a godsend to parents, but not to Victorian-era sewerage systems. Wipes marketed as flushable will probably be able to make their way down your toilet, but will eventually clog up the pipes further along their journey.
The kitchen is another area of concern.
