Schools in the San Francisco Bay Area have been cancelled for Friday and residents warned to stay inside as smoke descends from wildfires hundreds of miles away, producing air quality levels worse than notoriously polluted cities in India and China.

“Warmer air is above the colder air,” she said. “It acts like a lid. It basically just traps it right there, and we keep getting new smoke.”
The smoke is expected to be even worse Friday, and will likely remain at unhealthy levels through next week.
“Even the healthy among us are impacted,” Roselius said. Fine particulates can cause immediate health impacts, especially among children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions.
Demand for particle-grade face masks has soared, but experts warn that masks are not a substitute for staying indoors, and that they are not appropriate for children or people with beards.
