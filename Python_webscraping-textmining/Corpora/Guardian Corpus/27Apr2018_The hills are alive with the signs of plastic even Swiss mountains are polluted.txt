Microplastic pollution contaminates soil across 
In the first major study of microplastics in soil, the researchers analysed soil samples from 29 river flood plains in nature reserves across Switzerland. They found microplastics, fragments under 5mm in size, in 90% of the soils. The scientists believe the particles are carried across the country by the wind.
Research on microplastic pollution to date has largely concentrated on the oceans, in which it is found across the globe, 
Record levels of microplastics were 
Michael Scheurer and Moritz Bigalke at the Geographical Institute of the University of Bern, conducted the new research, which is published in the journal 
Microplastics were found even in remote mountain regions that can only be reached by foot. “We were really surprised,” said Bigalke. “All the areas were in national parks. We thought we might find one or two plastic particles, but we found a lot.”
Between 70-80% of the particles found were smaller than 0.5mm and the researchers said they are most likely to be blown across the country. “We think it has to be transported by the wind,” said Bigalke. “There is no other explanation – there are no settlements there [in the mountains], no tourism.”
Almost 100% of the plastic used in Switzerland is either recycled or incinerated, the highest rate in 
“There is a need for research into the question of how microplastics affect food production, and whether it can get into the food chain,” he said. 
Microplastic contamination in agricultural soils could be even worse, said Bigalke. They are known to be present in the sewage sludge produced at water treatment plants and this sludge is sometimes used as fertiliser on fields. Another new study found 
Bigalke said it was estimated that the application of sewage sludge to arable land alone could transport more could microplastics into the soil than that entering the world’s oceans.
