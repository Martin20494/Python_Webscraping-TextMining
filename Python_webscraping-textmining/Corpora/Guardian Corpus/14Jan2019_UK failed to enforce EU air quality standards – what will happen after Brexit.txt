Air pollution was until recently regarded as a problem mainly for those whose health was already compromised or vulnerable in some way: the very old, the very young, and those with existing respiratory problems such as asthma. Thanks to groundbreaking research in the last few years, we now know the problem goes much further, to the root of human health: air pollution has been linked to 
There is scarcely an aspect of human health that is not affected by the silent insinuation of this invisible killer into our lungs, our blood, our brains and every other organ.
Yet while the science has piled up, 
But it is now clear that diesel-powered vehicles are likely to be the worst offenders, and for decades government policy has been geared towards encouraging their uptake, through preferential tax rates. The criminal activities of some in the motor industry also outstripped governments’ ability to catch up with stronger enforcement.

The new air quality strategy is its response to concerns over air quality, claiming to be a replacement for the EU’s strict multi-year laws and science-based targets, and the mechanisms by which governments can be taken to account for not meeting these standards.
