The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research said that a reading of the filter at the Greenwich laboratory of its atmosphere pollution division showed that the average concentration of smoke was 2.48 milligrams a cubic metre. At midday the average concentration during the previous 24 hours was 1.3, compared with an average of 1.0 during the first day of the 1952 smog and 2.1 on the fourth day, when the degree of pollution reached its maximum.
