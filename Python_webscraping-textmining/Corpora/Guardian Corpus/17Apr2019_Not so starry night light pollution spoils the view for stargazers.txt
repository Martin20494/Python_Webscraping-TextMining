Light pollution is hindering a starry view of the night sky for more than half of people across England, a census has found.
Fifty-seven per cent of stargazers struggled to see more than 10 stars, while just 2% of participants said they experienced “truly dark skies” enabling them to count more than 30, according to the research by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).
People in towns and the countryside were encouraged to count 
Campaigners said the results of the star count, supported by the British Astronomical Association, demonstrated the problem of light pollution and how it affected “one of the countryside’s most magical sights – a dark, starry night sky”.
They said the results of the research to map England’s night skies suggested more could be done by the government, local councils and the general public to lessen the negative effects of artificial light from streets and buildings.
Emma Marrington, dark skies campaigner at the CPRE, said: “We’re hugely grateful to the many people who took the time to get out and take part in our star count. But it’s deeply disappointing that the vast majority were unable to experience the natural wonder of a truly dark sky, blanketed with stars. Without intervention, our night sky will continue to be lost under a veil of artificial light, 
“The star count results show just how far-reaching the glow from street lights and buildings can be seen. Light doesn’t respect boundaries, and careless use can see it spread for miles from towns, cities, businesses and motorways.”
She suggested better-designed lighting, street light dimming schemes and part-night lighting – where, in consultation with local communities and police, some street lights are turned off during the small hours – could provide an opportunity to limit the damage caused by light pollution, reduce carbon emissions and save money.
The CPRE said the star count, which ran for the first three weeks of February, involved 2,300 people. The full results
