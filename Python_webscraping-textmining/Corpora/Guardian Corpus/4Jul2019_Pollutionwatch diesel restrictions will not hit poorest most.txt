The UK study found restrictions on diesel vehicles would have least impact in poorer areas, since diesels are predominantly owned by wealthier people.
Restricting older vehicles would have more of an impact in poorer areas, but this effect was small: cars in the poorest areas were, on average, just over a year older than those owned by the most well-off. This was due to multi-car households in wealthier areas and the age of their second, third and in some cases, fourth cars. It seems poorer areas have least to lose and most to gain from reducing traffic pollution.
