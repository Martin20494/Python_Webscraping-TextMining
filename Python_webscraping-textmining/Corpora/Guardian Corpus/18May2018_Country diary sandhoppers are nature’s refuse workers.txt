The weed deposited along the strandline was sun-bleached and studded with marine detritus – dead crabs, cuttlebones, spongy balls of common whelk egg-cases and the ubiquitous litter of single-use plastics. Peeling back the mat of vegetation, I exposed a pulsing mass of sheltering sandhoppers (
Omnivorous scavengers, sandhoppers are nature’s refuse workers, helping to break down the vast quantities of dead and decaying material washed up on our shores. However, research undertaken by the University of Plymouth in 2017 revealed that these amphipods may actually be contributing to the spread of secondary microplastics within the marine environment. By monitoring them in the laboratory and on the shoreline, scientists discovered that they could
