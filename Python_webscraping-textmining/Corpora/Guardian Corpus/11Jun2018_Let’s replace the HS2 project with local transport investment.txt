A more effective way to improve transport throughout the country (and air quality) would be to use this £56bn to provide good quality local transport services. If this sum were to be shared between the 112 most populated towns and cities in the UK, they would have £500m each to invest in local infrastructure. It is possible and desirable to provide improvements for walking, cycling, better bus services and the introduction of rapid transit systems, but it seems it will have to wait until there is a change of government.
 I refer to your article about tenants in Network Rail’s arches (
As with all commercial property, rent reviews happen on a periodic basis as outlined in tenants’ leases. This is part of our normal business activity and has been for many years. Rents are based on local property market values. Some areas have seen marked regeneration in recent years which can increase rents. In these circumstances we work with tenants to come up with solutions that work for their business while meeting our commercial obligations.
As a publicly-funded company we use this rental income generated from private business to invest in, and improve our railway, helping to pay for things like new station lifts, new platforms and even new stations, thus helping to reduce the funding burden on the public purse. Any suggestion that our approach to rent reviews has changed so as to drive up the value of the estate ahead of the sale of our commercial estate (other than as a result of our normal business activities) is untrue.
In November 2017, we announced that we are selling our commercial estate business in England and Wales because it is a non-core railway asset and is a viable business to sell. Once the business is sold, all current leases will transfer to the buyer and all lease arrangements and protections will be unchanged. The tenants’ notice period will also continue as per their original lease agreement.
