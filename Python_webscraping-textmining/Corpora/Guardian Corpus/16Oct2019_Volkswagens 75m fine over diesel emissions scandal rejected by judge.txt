The ACCC has been pursuing Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft (VWAG) and its Australian subsidiary Volkswagen Group Australia through the courts since 2016 over “false or misleading conduct” involving the use of software which prompted diesel vehicles to produce lower-emissions fuels under test conditions.
About 11 million cars worldwide were sold as producing significantly lower emissions than they did under normal driving conditions.
Related proceedings against Audi AG and Audi Australia, subsidiaries of VWAG, were filed by the ACCC in 2017.
Volkswagen made no admissions in the agreed facts with regard to environmental or health impacts caused by higher emissions, and no admissions regarding the knowledge of its board.
It accepted the $75m penalty, which is three times higher than the record $26.5m penalty in an ACCC case levied against training college Empower Institute last month.
But federal court justice Lindsay Foster rejected the statement, saying, according to 
Foster questioned the imputation that the top layers of the corporation would not have known about the emissions software.
The ACCC declined to comment on the hearing beyond confirming it had submitted a statement of agreed facts and proposed orders to the federal court.
“The proposed orders include a penalty of $75m but it is ultimately for the court to decide the appropriateness of the penalty,” a spokeswoman said.
The decision has been reserved.
