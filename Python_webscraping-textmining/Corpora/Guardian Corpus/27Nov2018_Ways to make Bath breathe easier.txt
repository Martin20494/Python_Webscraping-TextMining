The proposed clean air zone for Bath places the financial burden of solving the pollution problem on individual motorists and businesses (
Charging to enter the clean air zone is a big stick but there are very few carrots being offered, particularly with respect to better public transport. Public acceptance of the clean air zone proposals would be greater if people could see there were genuine alternatives to using their cars. Reducing bus services at this time makes no sense.
 It seems that those residents of Keynsham who own diesel and older petrol vehicles could stop visiting Bath when its clean air zone comes into force in 2020. Monitoring undertaken by the council has shown that a charging zone would improve air quality in the city fairly quickly, and help ease the suffering of the 12,000 or so people with asthma in the Bath area. None of the other options that were looked at would work as effectively to bring down pollution. So I have some advice for the residents of Keynsham – try the bus. The local X39 bus operates every 30 minutes from Keynsham to Bath centre, a brilliant service. A small lifestyle change for drivers would bring worthwhile, measurable results.
 I pollute Bath’s environment with my old diesel car. I’d rather not. I’d rather take a bus into the city from my small village about six miles out. But the buses run only at 7.41am on Saturday, and on Sunday not at all. During the week I might squeeze on to the over-full service that runs two hourly but it is inconvenient and overpriced.
Bath councillors would do well to resolve issues with contracts awarded to First Direct and ensure there are other ways of getting to work, college or shops in Bath. A congestion charge will not improve the air quality in Bath, providing an efficient bus service just might.
