But the biggest source of damage to wildlife from litter comes from angling, according to the RSPCA’s findings, with discarded equipment such as lines, nets and hooks causing more than 3,200 of last year’s reports.

The RSPCA frequently sees cases where mammals and birds have died from infections caused by discarded fish hooks, from strangulation caused by fishing lines, or from wounds where plastic has cut into creatures’ bodies.
The spokeswoman said: “We would strongly urge those who enjoy fishing to be extra cautious when packing up to make sure no litter is left behind. Most anglers are very responsible when disposing of their litter, but it only takes one careless person to endanger the life of an animal.”
