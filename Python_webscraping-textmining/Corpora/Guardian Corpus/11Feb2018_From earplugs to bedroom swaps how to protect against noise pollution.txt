f you find it vexing that a loud bang can trigger a heart attack, bad news: it turns out a low rumble can, too. Several studies have identified 
The researchers from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany who compiled the research said one of the main ways noise pollution affects heart health is by disrupting sleep. Thankfully, there are simple way to mitigating those effects.
The most obvious solution for reducing noise exposure may also be the most effective: wear earplugs, especially at night. Alternatively, block outside noises that trigger stress responses by “playing some soothing masking noise”, advises Mike Stigwood, director of the environmental health consultancy MAS. “I use classical music,” he says.
Stephen Stansfeld, a professor of psychiatry at Queen Mary University of London, has studied the effects of noise pollution. If you live in a house beside a busy road, as many city dwellers do, he suggests moving your bedroom to the back of the house, away from that noise, so as not to be disturbed by passing lorries at 5am. “There is evidence to suggest having that quiet aspect can be helpful,” he says.
Noise in the home can be significantly reduced with double glazing or by installing specialist layers in walls or under carpets, such as those offered by Bolton-based Sound Reduction Systems. Richard Sherwood, the firm’s technical director, used its Maxiboard in his own walls “because I had noisy neighbours”.
Stigwood says he has measured regular noise levels of more than 90dB on the Central line, which is among the noisiest in the tube network. For context, employers are obliged to offer hearing protection to employees exposed to an average of more than 80 decibels at work.
