Fan and her colleagues were able to show that the tiniest particles in this plume spawn massive droplets, leading to heat release, followed by powerful updrafts and super-charged storms. 
Previously, these tiny particles were thought to be too small to aid droplet formation. In pristine areas (such as the Amazon and over oceans) tiny particles could be having a significant effect. 
“The results suggest that, from pre-industrial to the present day, human activity may have changed storms in these regions in powerful ways,” says Fan, whose findings are
