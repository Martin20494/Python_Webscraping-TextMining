In Sheffield – with 4.5 million trees, still Europe’s greenest city – we know that a small band choose to ignore the facts in their protests against our lawful tree replacement programme (
We continue to welcome peaceful protest, but it cannot be acceptable for a tiny minority of hardcore protesters to attempt the imposition of their views against the wishes of the majority of local residents who want the council to complete its programme of highways improvements, and the consequent wasting of large amounts of taxpayers’ money in additional programme costs and legal bills.
 Rather than castigating Sheffield for being a one-party state, perhaps Green councillor Alison Teal should consider the implication of her party’s failure to gain more seats on the city council, and what this says about how most residents feel about the tree protests. Could it be that people are more concerned about the effects of austerity – poverty, unemployment, somewhere to live – than the retention of some dying and dangerous trees in more affluent areas of the city, many of which will be replaced? I suspect her history is also misinformed: the Victorians may have wanted to improve quality of life when they planted trees, but I’m not sure their effect on pollution was a priority for 19th-century civic leaders.
 I wish the people of Sheffield every success in their struggle to save the trees. But I think Alison Teal might be pushing it a bit when she says that “Life expectancy if you live on a street with trees is around seven years longer; better mental health; more likely to exercise, more likely to walk”. My guess is that middle-class people already enjoy these benefits, as well as the income needed to afford houses in leafy avenues.
 A single mature tree can, in a season, absorb up to 48 pounds of carbon dioxide, soak up pollutants and produce enough oxygen to allow 10 of us to breathe. What calculations did Sheffield city council make of the impact on child health emanating from their destruction of 6,000 trees?
