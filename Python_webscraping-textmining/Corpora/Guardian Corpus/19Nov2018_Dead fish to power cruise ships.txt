Hurtigruten operates a fleet of 17 ships, and by 2021 aims to have converted at least six of its vessels to use biogas, liquefied natural gas – a fossil fuel, but cleaner than many alternatives – and large battery packs, capable of storing energy produced from renewable sources.

Hurtigruten is currently building three new hybrid-powered cruise ships in Norway, to be delivered in the next three years.
