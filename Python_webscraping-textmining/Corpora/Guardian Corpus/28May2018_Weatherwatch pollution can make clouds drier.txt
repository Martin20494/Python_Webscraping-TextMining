hat’s in a cloud? Water, certainly, but also tiny particles known as “aerosols”. Whether they originate from wildfires, volcanoes, sandstorms, ship emissions or power stations, aerosols alter the properties of a cloud. By providing a surface for water to condense on to, they can help water droplets to form. But exactly how aerosols alter clouds is not clear. Now a new satellite study is helping scientists to see inside a cloud.
Nicolas Bellouin, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared ordinary satellite images of clouds with infrared images. Clouds that appear plain white in ordinary images 
This observation contrasts with some climate models, which indicate that increasing aerosols should help clouds to become “wetter” by increasing their capacity to hold water. The findings also suggest that
