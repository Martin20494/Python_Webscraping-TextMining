In the US, the Dieselgate scandal has resulted in prosecutions against VW personnel and multibillion dollar fines (
Defeat devices result in higher emissions of nitrogen dioxide, but the real danger from a health perspective are small particulates, notably the ultra-fine nanoparticles that can penetrate tissue, reach a placenta and cross the blood-brain barrier. These are largely present in exhaust emissions, so while all vehicles generate particulates from tyres and brakes, researchers have demonstrated that medical effects such as low birth weight are tied more closely to exhaust particulates than to friction particulates. This is important as the government likes to pretend that all particulates are equivalent, regardless of the source. Thus its clean air strategy emphasises the contribution of secondary particulates generated from agriculture etc, even though these contain little in the way of ultra-fine particles. It is disheartening that the UK government seems more anxious to protect the interests of car manufacturers than the health of its own citizens, but this situation is likely to worsen post-Brexit.
 The proposals from Public Health England (PHE) that you reported (
Of course, an idling vehicle will emit more CO
The studies mentioned by PHE in its report advocating anti-idling do not consider most of these other pollutants, and there is a real risk of unintended harm, as emissions on start-up (whether warm or cold) often form a substantial part of the total emissions from a vehicleâ€™s journey. A 
There is a serious need to tackle air pollution, but to do so effectively will requires coherent interdisciplinary engagement and evidence-based policy making. The PHE document is a well-intentioned start, but we have a long way to go.
