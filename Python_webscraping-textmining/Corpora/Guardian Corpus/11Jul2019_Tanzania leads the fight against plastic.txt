Re your article about “Plastic City” on the outskirts of the Philippine capital of Manila (
In May this year 
Tanzania, a country 81st in the UN GDP listing (the UK is fourth), has done this, and the people we spoke to were very much in favour and, poor though they are, pay a few pence extra for a paper-based bag which can be used time and time again.
As a wealthy western country, all our government has done is bring in a small charge on single-use bags which, while dramatically reducing their use, still does not address the problem completely. This pussyfooted decision is a reflection on our government’s priorities – no doubt largely influenced by aggressive commercial lobbying.
 Our nine-year-old granddaughter visiting us on Sunday: “Granny, why are you keeping the paper straws in a plastic container?” Why indeed!
