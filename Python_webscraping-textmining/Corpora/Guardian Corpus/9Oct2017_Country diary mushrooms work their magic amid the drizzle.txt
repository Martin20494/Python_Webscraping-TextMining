These grassland fungi are not just good to look at. They are often found in sites rich in plants and invertebrates, and can be good habitat indicators. They appear to require a complete absence of both ploughing and artificial fertilisers, a preference shared with many herb-rich swards. Their sensitivity to nitrogen, indicated by a refusal to produce mushrooms, is so extreme that it has been used to track illicit fertiliser applications to protected sites. And yet good waxcap grasslands can have indifferent plant communities: their exact relation to the plants among which they nestle remains mysterious. Their subterranean growth is almost impossible to isolate from the soil, and their spores refuse to germinate under laboratory conditions, let alone grow, making most of their life cycle a tantalising puzzle.
That first foray of the season was fruitless. When we returned the weather was worse, a clinging drizzle that coated your eyelashes, but the mushrooms had worked their magic. Speckling the turf were swamp-green parrot waxcaps (
