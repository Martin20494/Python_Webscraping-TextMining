In the months leading up to the inquiry, industry groups including Canegrowers and AgForce had sponsored a speaking tour by the controversial scientist Dr Peter Ridd, who claims that the reef is not being damaged by farm pollution. He also disputes evidence for human-caused climate change, and claims that mass coral bleaching events on the reef are natural.
The campaign had aimed to pressure the Queensland government to withdraw proposed legislation,

In his submission, Shine wrote: “The Australian Academy of Science is greatly concerned about a recent tendency to ‘cherrypick’, dismiss, misrepresent, or obscure scientific evidence or smear individual scientists.”
Later in the submission, he added: “A commonly used tactic in opposing or advocating for policy positions is to ‘cherrypick’ scientific findings rather than consulting and analysing the body of literature systematically.
“Cherrypicking evidence to support a decision or position is dangerous and leads to poor judgment and outcomes.”
The academy said it backed the methods and findings of a 
The Australian Environment Foundation – a group that promotes climate science denial and supported Ridd’s tour – has also written to the inquiry, repeating Ridd’s claims that science linking farm pollution to the reef was “demonstrably wrong or unreliable”.
