It comes into force on 8 April 2019, and will initially cover the existing congestion charge zone in central London, but will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. From 25 October 2021, it will expand to an area bounded by the north and south circular roads.
Vehicles, including motorbikes, that don’t meet the tighter exhaust emissions standards will have to pay £12.50 every day that they are used within the ULEZ – the city centre one from this April, the bigger one from October 2021 – plus the £11.50 congestion charge if they enter the city centre between Monday and Friday, 7am to 6pm. Failure to pay will result in a fine of £160. Lorries will be charged £100 a day, with a £1,000 fine for failing to pay on time.
Broadly speaking, pre-2015 diesels and pre-2006 petrol cars will fall foul of the new standards. To find out if your car or bike is affected, go to 
Yes, to a degree. London’s 21,000 black cabs are among its dirtiest vehicles, diesels that pump out 16% of all transport nitrous oxide (NOx) in central London. Yet this powerful lobby group have been given an exemption, unlike London’s police cars, ambulances and fire engines, many of which will have to be replaced to meet the new standards.
TfL says that all new taxis must be zero-emission, but existing ones – even a diesel bought in 2017 – can run for up to 15 years without being subject to the charge.
Yes. Keepers of vehicles registered with a “disabled” or “disabled passenger vehicles” tax class will benefit from a “sunset period” after the ULEZ starts, meaning they won’t have to pay until 26 October 2025.
TfL has about 1,000 cameras for the congestion charge zone, but the expanded ULEZ will be 18 times bigger. Quite how small hops within the expanded zone will be monitored is not yet clear. TfL has not said how many more cameras will be put in place, but it may use “existing infrastructure and transportable cameras”. It will be interesting to see if this includes the ANPR cameras that currently exist on many buses to catch cars wrongly using bus lanes.
