He said that as well as reducing pollution, the strategy set out a clear path for Britain to be a world leader in zero-emission transport, which represented “a huge global opportunity for industry and business” worth £1tn a year by 2030.
However, environmental groups accused the government of weakening its commitments. Greenpeace said the car industry was “yet again being given a free pass” and the targets were weak by international standards. The Campaign for Better Transport said it was disappointing, describing it as “a step backwards, giving concessions to keeping hybrids on the road, which will water down the already inadequate 2040 target”. 
But Grayling told the Guardian: “I don’t think it’s watered down at all … We want to get rid of classic petrol and diesel engines. It’s about supporting the industry to deliver it and encouraging changes to consumer behaviour. I expect by 2040 every vehicle to have substantial zero-emission capability and most to be 100% zero-emission.”
The motor industry had argued that the 2040 targets were contributing to consumer fears over diesel cars, 
He said the industry welcomed the “technology neutral approach” and the news that hybrids would not be banned but remained concerned over 2030 targets for ultra-low emission vehicles. “We need realistic ambition levels and measures that support industry’s efforts, allow manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and provide the right incentives and infrastructure to take the consumer with us,” he said.
