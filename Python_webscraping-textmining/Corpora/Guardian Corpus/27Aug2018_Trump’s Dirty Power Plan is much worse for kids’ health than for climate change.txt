But there’s a silver lining – 
Many news stories about the Dirty Power Plan 
That sounds like a big difference between the two plans, and it confused a lot of reporters. The key point is that US electricity generation was already becoming cleaner 
One of the remarkable things about the new EPA assessment released for Trump's power plan, isn't even related to the new plan.
The EPA’s new analysis found that under the Clean Power Plan, carbon pollution from US electricity generation would have fallen 29% below 2005 levels by 2030, and under the Dirty Power Plan, it would fall 26% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Both appear to be extremely conservative estimates – remember, US power sector carbon pollution already fell 25% below 2005 levels by 2016 – but the point is that the climate difference between the plans is relatively small.
Basically, the Obama Clean Power Plan tried to accelerate the transition away from coal power, but it’s already happening so fast that it couldn’t go much faster. The Trump Dirty Power Plan tried to save the coal industry, but the coal death spiral has so much momentum that they could only tap the brakes and slow it down a bit. The EPA estimates that US coal production will be just 8% higher in 2030 under the Dirty Power Plan than it would have been under the Clean Power Plan.
While that slight increase in coal production won’t have a big climate impact, it’s 
900 more premature deaths per year
40,000 more annual cases of asthma
42,000 lost work days
60,000 more school absence days
230,000 more restricted-activity days for kids
The EPA analysis concludes that the costs of these adverse health effects
