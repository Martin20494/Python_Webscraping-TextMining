It is impossible to disagree with the Food and Land Use Coalition 
First, we do need to support the small-scale, family-based business structure. This is the only way of sustainable farming in the uplands and less productive land areas. All land use requires management, even woodland. This is not poor resource use; it is supporting public benefit from business centres that would otherwise not be financially viable.
Second, good sustainable farming can be compatible with good wildlife and habitat management. I do it every day. But it requires some well-thought-out financial incentives in small, monitored quantities. Finally, we need a micro-management farm-level approach to this funding. No more broad-brush schemes, please.
